``permutation`` provides a `Permutation` class for representing `permutations
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation>`_ of finitely many positive
integers in Python.  Supported operations & properties include inverses, (group
theoretic) order, parity, composition/multiplication, cycle decomposition,
cycle notation, word representation, Lehmer codes, and, of course, use as a
callable on integers.


Installation
============
``permutation`` is written in pure Python with no dependencies.  Just use `pip
<https://pip.pypa.io>`_ (You have pip, right?) to install::

    pip install permutation


Examples
========

>>> from permutation import Permutation
>>> p = Permutation(2, 1, 4, 5, 3)
>>> p.to_cycles()
[(1, 2), (3, 4, 5)]
>>> print(p)
(1 2)(3 4 5)
>>> print(p.inverse())
(1 2)(3 5 4)
>>> p.degree
5
>>> p.order
6
>>> p.is_even
False
>>> p.lehmer(5)
27
>>> q = Permutation.cycle(1,2,3)
>>> print(p * q)
(2 4 5 3)
>>> print(q * p)
(1 3 4 5)
>>> for p in Permutation.group(3):
...     print(p)
...
1
(1 2)
(2 3)
(1 3 2)
(1 2 3)
(1 3)
